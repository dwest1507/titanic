# Introduction
The purpose of this exploratory analysis is to test out different machine learning algorithms.

# Models

data <- train %>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, factor) %>% 
  mutate(Survived = factor(Survived))

randomForest(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Age, data = data, importance=T, na.action = median)
